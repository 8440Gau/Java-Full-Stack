Prerequisite : Static blocks, Initializer block, Constructor

In a Java program, operations can be performed on methods, constructors and initialization blocks.
Instance Initialization Blocks : IIB are used to initialize instance variables. IIBs are executed before constructors. They run each time when object of the class is created.
Initializer block : contains the code that is always executed whenever an instance is created. It is used to declare/initialize the common part of various constructors of a class.
Constructors : are used to initialize the objectâ€™s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at time of Object creation.

Order of execution of Initialization blocks and constructor in Java

Static initialization blocks will run whenever the class is loaded first time in JVM
Initialization blocks run in the same order in which they appear in the program.
Instance Initialization blocks are executed whenever the class is initialized and before constructors are invoked. They are typically placed above the constructors within braces.

// Java code to illustrate order of

class GFG { 
  
    GFG(int x) 
    { 
        System.out.println("ONE argument constructor"); 
    } 
  
    GFG() 
    { 
        System.out.println("No  argument constructor"); 
    } 
  
    static
    { 
        System.out.println("1st static init"); 
    } 
  
    { 
        System.out.println("1st instance init"); 
    } 
  
    { 
        System.out.println("2nd instance init"); 
    } 
  
    static
    { 
        System.out.println("2nd static init"); 
    } 
  
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
        new GFG(); 
        new GFG(8); 
    } 
} 
Output

1st static init
2nd static init
1st instance init
2nd instance init
No  argument constructor
1st instance init
2nd instance init
ONE argument constructor
Note : If there are two or more static/initializer blocks then they are executed in the order in which they appear in the source code.
